    <h2>What is This Website?</h2>
    <p>
    	This is the official website of the 2nd International (Virtual) Workshop on Autonomous Agents for Social Good (AASG) 2021, which is co-located with the 20th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
    	This workshop aims to highlight the role of multi-agent systems (MAS) in social challenges. MAS research has recently achieved significant success in industrial and academic challenges with focuses ranging from theoretical contribution to applied research. There is a growing interest to ensure various underrepresented social challenges are also studied and benefited from research in MAS. The goal of this workshop is to identify new MAS problems in societies, develop novel MAS solutions to resolve social challenges, and learn from the real-world deployment of MAS solutions in societies. This workshop expects to broaden the focus of MAS in social challenges and increase the diversity of MAS research.
    </p>
    <p>
	This workshop focuses on the role of multi-agent systems in social challenges and how MAS solutions can benefit societies. For example, what role can MAS play in tackling the challenges in environmental sustainability? How can MAS techniques be used to determine public health policy? What actions can MAS research suggest to promote social justice? To bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners, this workshop provides a platform to exchange information between MAS researchers and practitioners who work on real-world challenges. We expect to invite speakers from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and practitioners to share their experiences in social challenges, followed by a panel discussion and poster section to exchange ideas. The goal is to understand the current state of research in MAS and the practice in social challenges, encouraging more collaboration between researchers and stakeholders of social challenges. The workshop will feature a mix of invited talks, panel discussions, research talks, and poster sessions. This workshop welcomes submissions spanning the full range of theoretical and applied works in MAS and social challenges.
