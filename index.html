    <h4>Workshop Introduction</h4>
    <p>
    This is the official website of the 3rd International Workshop on Autonomous Agents for Social Good (AASG) 2022, which is co-located with <a target="_blank" href="https://aamas2022-conference.auckland.ac.nz/">the 21st International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) 2022</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    	This workshop aims to highlight the role of multi-agent systems (MAS) in social challenges. MAS research has recently achieved significant success in industrial and academic challenges with focuses ranging from theoretical contribution to applied research. There is a growing interest to ensure various underrepresented social challenges are also studied and benefited from research in MAS. The goal of this workshop is to identify new MAS problems in societies, develop novel MAS solutions to resolve social challenges, and learn from the real-world deployment of MAS solutions in societies. This workshop expects to broaden the focus of MAS in social challenges and increase the diversity of MAS research.
