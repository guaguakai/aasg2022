    <h4>Scope</h4>
    <p>
    This workshop focuses on the role of multi-agent systems in social challenges and how MAS solutions can benefit societies. For example, what role can MAS play in tackling the challenges in environmental sustainability? How can MAS techniques be used to determine public health policy? What actions can MAS research suggest to promote social justice? To bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners, this workshop provides a platform to exchange information between MAS researchers and practitioners who work on real-world challenges. We expect to invite speakers from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and practitioners to share their experiences in social challenges, followed by a panel discussion and poster section to exchange ideas. The goal is to understand the current state of research in MAS and the practice in social challenges, encouraging more collaboration between researchers and stakeholders of social challenges. The workshop will feature a mix of invited talks, panel discussions, research talks, and poster sessions. This workshop welcomes submissions spanning the full range of theoretical and applied works in MAS and social challenges.
