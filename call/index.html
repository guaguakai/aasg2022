    <p>
    This workshop focuses on the role of multi-agent systems in social challenges and how MAS solutions can benefit societies. For example, what role can MAS play in tackling the challenges in environmental sustainability? How can MAS techniques be used to determine public health policy? What actions can MAS research suggest to promote social justice? To bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners, this workshop provides a platform to exchange information between MAS researchers and practitioners who work on real-world challenges. We expect to invite speakers from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and practitioners to share their experiences in social challenges, followed by a panel discussion and poster section to exchange ideas. The goal is to understand the current state of research in MAS and the practice in social challenges, encouraging more collaboration between researchers and stakeholders of social challenges. The workshop will feature a mix of invited talks, panel discussions, research talks, and poster sessions. This workshop welcomes submissions spanning the full range of theoretical and applied works in MAS and social challenges.

    <h2>Scope of Multi-agent Systems</h2>
    <p>
        This workshop welcomes any papers studying social challenges with MAS involved, including but not limited to (i) identifying challenges within different domains in social good with multi-agent systems involved, e.g., multi-agent interaction, communication, selfishness, challenges of collecting MAS data, and how to use MAS to resolve these issues, (ii) multi-agent system solutions for social challenges, including algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, optimization, machine learning, and reinforcement learning, etc., and (iii) real-world deployment of MAS solutions in various applications in social good.
    </p>
